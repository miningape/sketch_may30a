# Ardiuno frequency detector
I wrote this code and built this device for a school project, since my school didn't have the equipment I needed.

This is the code for a frequency detector that uses an arduino to detect the frequency of a piston powered by a stirling engine. Every time the engine completes a full cycle a piece of tinfoil is brought into a position where it can complete a circuit. When the circuit is completed I register a pulse. This program measures the time between pulses and hence it outputs the period of pulses or the frequency of pulses.

From then I took the data it generated and manipulated it using Excel to analyse the relationship between the power and the load being placed on the engine.
